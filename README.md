Vishnu's Applied Science Portfolio comprises projects that have built her knack for asking the right questions toward creative problem-solving. The problem spaces of the projects below range from urban issues and real estate datasets to computer vision and interactive play for creative ideation. Her coding process is driven by curiosity and a rigorous, questioning approachâ€”never taking assumptions for granted and carefully considering the unknowns and variables that shape each problem space, including dataset constraints.

The diverse problem spaces Vishnu has explored have honed her creative, analytical, and research-driven approach to problem-solving. Her methodical approach to deconstructing complex challenges into manageable components reflects a scientific, reasoning-based process. She is a PhD research scientist at Viata, a startup that visualizes travel times to multiple destinations at a glance. Much of her work as a research scientist demonstrates her strength in identifying root causes of issues, including product design and business needs, through a rigorous user-centered approach. 

Her solid foundation in design and a degree in architecture give her a distinct advantage in creative problem-solving, design ideation, and leveraging design thinking methodologies. With a background in Entrepreneurship and a PhD in Human-Centered Design and Engineering, Vishnu is deeply focused on user-centered design and engineering. Her projects are centered on user research she conducts from critical insight into business and product development needs in conjunction with the user's lived experiences. Central to her work is an understanding and empathy that drives her strategic engagement with users and technical stakeholders. She founded an urban tech startup and built and managed a website to foster public engagement.
